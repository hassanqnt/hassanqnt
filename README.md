## Hi, I'm Hassan 👋

I have experience in financial services and a strong interest in programming and data driven problem solving.
I enjoy building analytical tools, exploring financial data and learning how technology can improve decision making in markets.

My interests include:
- Financial markets and analysis
- Building algos
- Quantitative and analytical thinking

I’m always looking to improve my technical skills and deepen my understanding of how finance and technology intersect.
